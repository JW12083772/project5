	  <h1>Why Did I Join Photography?</h1>
	  <p><img src="../images/rained.JPG" width="250" height="171" alt=""/><span style="font-family: neonoir, sans-serif; font-size: 16pt;">It started a few years ago,</span> &nbsp;where I honestly was justbored and really needed something to do. So as a hobby I decided to pick up photography, which was now possible due to the fact that I no longer needed to take art for Drafting as I did not want to go into that field anymore after having a horrible experience with the class. My teacher was Ms. gaimari and she taught me most of the essentials I now know and use.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

	  <h1>Why Did I Duit Drafting?</h1>
	  <p><img src="../images/snow.JPG" alt="" width="250" height="190" class="floatLeft"/><span style="font-family: neonoir, sans-serif; font-size: 16pt;">TL;DR of it was poor teaching, </span>which is not the teacher's fault too much as he was brand new. Our old drafting teacher left as she would needed her degree in teaching to continu, but she was not able to get one at the moment, so we got a new guy. He was a really nice guy, and a good architect, but did not know a thing about teaching. This led us to essentially just sit around for an hour making it look like we are doing work, going between projects too easy for us, or projects way out of our league. This went on for months and although we got a sub who could teach us, I never wanted to touch drafting again.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

	  <p><img src="../images/grass.jpg" width="250" height="164" alt=""/><span style="font-family: neonoir, sans-serif; font-size: 16pt;">Not too much, </span>currently going to get my degree in Statistics and Data Analytics, which might seem like a weird choice after everything I have talked about but it works for me. I still occasionally do photography when I have the time and have come to enjoy landscape photos as my favorite. Wha lies ahead, time will tell, and I would be impressed if someone manage to read all this text, you must really find me interesting, so thanks for that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
